Hello, I am using this README to practice source controll. 


## Main Branch ##
This is the main branch
Success, ive changed branched and now only this stuff is showing up. Now to push to remote repo on the main branch

## New Branch ## 
This is the new branch. This part of the code should only show up when were working on the new branch. 
Now I will try to push these changes to the remote repository on this new-branch. 

## Next Branch ##
This is the next branch in the line. I just merged the main branch with the new-branch but I had to resolve some conflicts. I think this is because when I was working on the new-branch I was also making changes to the main branch, so when I went to merge them, nothing was lines up. So this time I am only making changes to the next-branch. lets see how that goes when I merge these puppies. (I will merge them via a pull request via github, on the next next branch I will try to merge them all with the CLI)
